# trilateral3 
### requires atleast haxe4.2

GPU triangle drawing engine core, low level.

### Dependancies
The code is 100% Haxe and uses a range of helper libraries to complement the basics, there are no macros used but does use Abstract extensively and Module-level functions.

**trilateral3** has some dependancies and optional dependancies:
- trilateral3.geom.* requires dsHelper to provide Float32Array abstracts, it's possible to implement your own functionality for DrawAbstract and ColorAbstract and your not constrained to storing data in Arrays, it's just easier to wire them to a shader by calling toArray.
- trilateral3.drawing.fill requires algorithm libraries hxPolyK, poly2trihx, hxGeomAlgo if you don't use fills you may not need these installed.
- trilateral3.matrix.* can optionally be used with geom maths library, but should be feasible to use with hxMaths instead, or without any, looking to provide an example in the future with hxMath perhaps.
- pallette is likely a dependancy, it just provides colors, so I may try to make optional in future.
- justPath is used for SVG path drawing likely optional.
- fracs is currently required for angle calculations.

For general quick setup it is suggested you install kitGL to help with WebGL or Lime setup, it also provides some helpers for general javascript use. This engine can be used with OpenGL or any system that draws triangles with the GPU.

Currently a simple WebGL example can be found github.com/nanjizal/trilateral3Minimal you can find an hxml script to help install required dependancies from github.

### Usage

#### Pen, Sketch and Regular

The concept is you create a Pen with AbstractDraw and AbstractColor implementation, typically this is via an abstract around a Float32Array or possibly Int16Array, but your free to swap to a different storage. An ideal approach is to use FlatColorTriangles class for both AbstractDraw and AbstractColor, see the minimal example of typical setup, it's a bit ugly but allows flexibility for different shader setups.

Once you have a pen you can use Shaper to create shapes, they return an index of vertices and that is used to add color.

Alternatively you can pass the Pen to Sketch and then your able to use regular line and curve draw commands or even Svg paths.  

Regular extends Sketch and is a quite an easy way to create RegularShapes, it return an IndexRange you can keep to extract the shapes later to transform or re-colour.

Typical drawing code might look like:

``` haxe
pen.width = 10;
sketch.moveTo( x0, y0 );
sketch.lineTo( x1, y1 );
sketch.cuveThru( x3, y3, x4, y4 );
```

Although it's often easier to feed it an SVG path as a string.

#### Styles

Contours can be drawn with lots of triangles or less, the StyleSketch currently determines if the corners between lines are smooth, just a triangle, or just overlapping rectangles. For simple shapes you can obviously use Shaper or Regular for outlines or fills.  To draw and fill a Contour you must use two StyleSketch a Fill and one other.

StyleEndLine this is used to define how Sketch ends line drawings with rounded ends or blunt.

StyleFill this is used to determine the Fill style used.

#### Transforms

The default Abstract Float32Array's can have transforms applied over the whole drawing or to specific IndexRanges.

The matrix and vector maths internally is very minimal, but can be eaisly setup to use geom or similar math library so you can do fancy stuff like control shapes in 3D, this can be done on the abstract Float32Array or on the matrix passed to the Shader.

### Supported Toolkits

Currently the original Trilateral provided examples in OpenFL/NME, Heaps, WebGL, Canvas, SVG, Kha graphics2 or graphics4, and Armory3D Iron.

Trilateral3 provides bare bones for WebGL, using kitGL you can easily setup a similar Lime example an the helpers are all mirrored, and as before it should be very easy to use with Kha and largely concepted against Kha. Currently there has been no progress with low level Heaps support, assistance would be ideal, but if speed is not vital you can just pass the arrays to a drawTriangle function.

### Textures and Gradients

The orginal Trilateral has Texture support and a way to use Gradients it requires two draws. Trilateral3 does not yet have details finalized, but does provide an angular gradient for circles which could be extended and is possible to use as 3 color gradient on a circle. Essentially for texture uv coordinates based on the xy positions can be passed, they just require a different transform ( 0 -> 1 rather than -1 -> 1 ) and may require some tweeking of TRIANGLE corner order.

### 2.5D

With hxMath or geom it is easy to draw 2D shapes in 3D, you can either transform them via the abstract Float32Array structures or via a Shader matrix.

### Font and extruded shapes.

Drawing text with Trilateral3 is possible but it soon takes up a lot of triangles so these should be drawn to an intermediate texture to reduce overhead, ideally each letter could then be drawn to screen with two triangles there are some tests of concepts on my repo.

### Lots of triangles

Trilateral3 in fine mode uses excessive amount of triangles, it is best to watch your needs and draw to intermediate textures if needed. kitGL provides a class called texture it has some basic canvas draw commands and the gl context, but it also has drawImage to help with drawing between 'textures', textures needs renaming.

### Trilateral verses Trilateral3
The structure is much improved but it's true that Trilateral had more examples with texture, fxg, alpha etc.. but the base is there these can be added.
